## Description

### React Native using Expo and Typescript

A [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) Chat app using the [Expo framework](https://expo.io), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org). Expo has supported Typescript natively since version 31.

## Prerequisites

Install `expo-cli` globally.

```shell
npm install --global expo-cli
```

If you prefer to use yarn the command is `yarn global add expo-cli`.

Git clone.

```shell
git clone git@version.aalto.fi:CS-E4100/mcc-2018-g13.git # or
git clone https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/CS-E4100/mcc-2018-g13.git
```

Cd to ChatApp directory and Install dependencies.

```shell
cd ChatApp && npm install
```

## Running the App

### Building the Android .apk-file

Run

```shell
npm run build
```

and download the file from link generated by Expo.

### Developing

Start the local server. This will give you a QR code that you can scan using the Expo Client app on your mobile device. The app supports hot reload.

```shell
npm start
```

If you"re on a Mac and have Xcode installed, you can run the app using the iOS Simulator with the following command. I am sure you can do something similar with Android.

```shell
npm ios
```

Other scripts

```shell
  npm run lint              # Run linter
  npm run compile           # Compile Typescript to JS, serve from dist directory
  npm run clean             # Remove dist folder (compiled code)
  npm run plop              # Create new component from a template
```
